We, at Ducia, strive to create a fun and informative platform for young women, to help them develop both professionally and personally. We want to do so, by creating an event and online platform. The event would be interactive with workshops that teach self-love, self-defense, but also choosing career paths and finding your true self. The online platform is a way of getting in touch with others, they can read stories about experiences and get in touch with Ducia as well. We want the visitors to empower and talk to each other and spread their experiences. <br>
We want to people to come in contact with us, the brand and experience experts. Therefor we chose to add a contact page as well, because of the fact that we want to help our visitors with their problems, that is where our brand stands for and we want to reflect our vision to the website. If they need more help  about certain struggles, they will be able to read testimonials from experts to help them out on the home page. On the contact page they will be able to contact us and find our social media channels, this will make them more eager to visit our socials and this will result in a bigger community.<br>
We also created a page in the navigation bar where tickets for our events can be bought. So our customers can easily find this and know what is on our calendar. This is how the brand is going to earn money, so it needs to be easy reachable and have a important role on the website.<br>

		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">navigation structure</span><br>
				 
				 
					 
For the general layout of the website, we wanted simplicity, clarity and a specific style. This minimal website should look sophisticated and easy to follow. For the simplicity of the website we work in blocks, these blocks are all in the same color palette of white, red/purple and pink.
					 <br><br>
To make our website easy to follow we clearly identify when new areas in the website start. We used a white block for the header, which is then divided by a line to indicate a new block for the navigation bar, followed by a big transparent pink block to indicate the currently active page. The block with active page is given a lot of attention and is made big so the user of the website can see at a glance on which page they are on. This also shows the user, this is where the content starts. When it comes to the actual content of the page we work in blocks inside a container, this container is used to identify content and what the actual page is about.
To clearly identify content, we gave each block a transparent pink background, which attracts the viewers focus. A light font is used throughout the content of the whole website, this is used to indicate simplicity and clarity and a feeling of ethereal/relief. Above each of these content blocks is a h2 heading placed in lowercase, this indicates what the following block is about and again shows simplicity. The heading is placed just above the block and is meant to connect the content block to actual page, giving it a coherent flow to read.
The content is followed by the footer, the footer of this website is relatively dark. This is done on purpose. On top of the page we start with that exact color in the logo and navigation bar top-border, and they are both put in container-fluid divs. Ending with this main color creates a feeling of full circle, which is naturally satisfying and using both container-fluid divs make it feel as a united layout. This dark block also indicated a new section and an end to the website.
<br><br>
Header - To start of the page, we have our brand name in the largest size font to be found on the website, because in the end, this is what the website is about. The whole header only has one specific color, as using colors would disrupt the viewers attention and feels out of place. Next to the title, the simple logo can be found of Ducia. This logo is put next to the brand title to show a connection to it, the logo shows a female body that looks strong and confident, we wanted to reflect that next to our title as that is what our brand is about. Underneath the title a tagline can be found, this clearly shows our message of female empowerment with the words “She makes the difference”. This has the font Dawning of a New Day, that looks like a girl’s handwriting, graceful and pretty, which again emphases our brand message.
<br><br>
Navigation - The navigation bar below the header, first of all, is made sticky. This is done to make it easy to navigate throughout the whole website no matter where you are. Inside the navigation bar we start off with the logo. The reason for this is that we want to communicate our message through out the whole website. As the navigation bar is made sticky, the logo will be projected on the website no matter your screen size or where you are on the website’s content. Followed by the ‘| navigation |’ with a divider on each side to separate it from the logo and the clickable menu-items. This is just for simplicity and to represent the navigation bar at all times (even in smaller windows). The menu-items are black and grey with a white background. The white background is put there on purpose to separate itself from the content. To still create a separation from the header, we placed a top-border. The active menu-item is black, showing on which page you currently are, while the other remain grey representing an inactive state, this is done for clarity purposes. On the far right of the navigation bar you can see a login button, this is not functional as this is just a prototype of how we would actually present our brand if we were established. The login button is red to be consistent in color and style and clearly differ from the white/pink/purple background. The navigation bar is responsive, so that smaller screens can fold out the navigation bar, making it easier to navigate on all platforms.
					 <br><br>
Footer - As mentioned before the footer of the webpage is dark on purpose. To make the text more readable in this section we made it white. Just like the headings in the content part, the headings in the footer have the same font (Georgia), and are set a little to the left. The actual content of the footer is again done with the font Raleway to be consistent. <br><br>
On bigger screens the footer is 50% filled by the about and links section and for 50% filled by the newsletter section. This is because usually, email dresses are longer and upon signing up for the newsletter we want the user to be able to fully read their email before clicking submit, giving the user a better experience.
The footer is made responsive so that each column of content is placed beneath each other on smaller screens, resulting in easy readability. Beneath the about column we have quick links to our social media, if people are interested, they can immediately click on them and follow us, this is done more advanced on the contact page. The quick navigation links are very simple and divided by white bottom-borders. The navigation links have a short simple animation, when the user hovers over it with their cursor. This is to clearly show that the link is selected and that when the user clicks it will certainly take them to that page. <br>
Just beneath the footer we have a copyright section that uses the same background color as the footer, but in a lighter shade. In this copyright section we wanted to show the year in which the site is made, the brand name and the contributors and their student numbers.

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">google fonts</span><br>
				 
				
We used the font Georgia for our title and header, this is a very classis font and it reminds of quality design. To weigh up against this, we chose to use Raleway (sans-serif) for our main content, which balances out really well with the Georgia font, because of the fact that the two fonts are so different but fill in each other. It is curly and classic against modern and simplistic.
In our header, we also made use of a different google font, which is named: Dawning of a New Day. We used this for our slogan, to make it more playful and stand out from our titles, header and main content. This font, Dawning of a New Day, looks like a girl’s handwriting, graceful and pretty, which again emphases our brand message and values.

Our primary colour is purple (hex; #7F142F) the colour is known as Claret, it belongs to the wine colours. We chose this colour because it is very classy and feminine. Our website it meant for (young) adult women so it fits our target group really well. The other colours used on the website, are different shades of pink: Hex; #F1A2B6 in different transparencies which are 0,30 and 0,15. All these colors are associated with elegance, femininity and clarity.</p>

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">home page</span><br>
				 
			
There are three main sections on the homepage that the user lands on when they click our link. We chose to use the sections ‘who we are’, ‘testimonials’ and ‘quick contact’ for the homepage. When the user visits our website, they should immediately know what our brand and service is about. <br>
We start of by giving a short introduction on who we are, so the users know a bit more about the brand. This is done with a placeholder for a picture that would be filled in by the team, if the brand were realized. Next to the picture is a paragraph, because this connects the text to the image, so the user knows that these are linked. Of course, the website is made responsive, so on smaller screens these are beneath each other. This is followed by a carousel showing pictures of the events that we want to organize as a brand. This takes up the whole container, aside from some margins. We want to clearly show our user what our events feel like and grab their attention. If a user is interested in joining our event after reading about who we are and seeing the pictures, we put a button below leading to the events page on which the user can get their tickets. This is straight-forward and clear to the user and enhances our easy usability. <br>
Underneath the ‘who we are’ section we have a ‘testimonials’ section of mock guests. This is done in two separate blocks, to tell two separate stories and opinions. The paragraph is styled in cursive and between quotation marks, to show that this is a quote by one of our guests. The paragraph is placed around the place holder image which would be the actual person if this was a real testimonial. The reason for this placement is because the story revolves around the person, and so the text wraps around the image. The testimonial has an image to make the user feel more connected and personally touched by the story. Which again communicates our message of women making a difference. <br>
Finally, there is a quick contact form. We want to seem approachable to our guest and easy to communicate with, so if the user is interested or has a story to share, they can immediately do so on the home page. After reading the ‘testimonials’ and the ‘who we are’ section they could feel inspired and share more about them. The contact form of course is responsive as well. If user would fill in this form they would show interest in our brand, so we gave them the option of signing up to our newsletter. Making it again simple and easy to give the user what they want.

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">about page</span><br>
				 
				
The about page starts with the vision of Ducia. Under the title ‘what we stand for’. This way we implemented the vision and the mission. We divided the vision up into three separate blocks, because it is a lot information to state in one ‘paragraph’. The three blocks will show the why we exist, what we believe in (vision) and what we want to achieve(mission). Visitors can read it as one sentence but can also read it as the vision and mission. 
We put the values in a carousel. Instead of just reading words, the image will show how Ducia implements this value into their ‘service’. Beneath each value's we added a small text, to make sure our meaning of the world is, or can become, the same as the visitors.<br>
The carousel is both automatic and controllable for the visitor itself.  It is made to make it more convenience for the visitor, they have the control of what they want to see. It also automatically changes to assure that all values have a chance to be seen. <br>
With the images of the carousel we want to achieve a feeling of what the target audience can be, and a glimpse of the events. Therefore, we have incorporated business photo's as well as fun gatherings.
We wanted to briefly introduce the team, we put it at the bottom, after the vision and values as the home page also has a paragraph about the team. With the photo of the female team, we want to convey a by women for women brand. <br>
At the end of the about page, we put two buttons, one linked to the event page and the second to the contact page.  We want to directly guide the visitor towards the event page were they can buy tickets. If they have any questions about something what isn’t on the about page, or website, we want to make sure they feel invited to contact us.
<br> <br>

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">events page</span><br>
				 
				
On the events page we have four sections; ‘a look inside’, ‘calendar’, ‘tickets’, and ‘personal details’. All the essential sections need to give the user the information about the event and the ability to join one of our events. <br>
We start of the webpage with ‘a look inside’, this is done to give the user an immediate feeling of joy, inspiration and invitation and should appeal to the user, that is why it is takes up the full row. Following we have a responsive ‘calendar’ in the colors of our brand. This is a very simple styled calendar and shows the user when they can expect events of our brand. In the event title we could give a quick description of what
the event is about. Continued by a ‘tickets’ section, the user can see which options we have for attending our events, if we would realize our brand, we want the user to get a customized experience when attending an event based on their needs. If the user would want extra coaching, workshops etc. they can choose a different ticket with a different pack and add that to their cart. The ticket options are made by the bootstrap component ‘cards’ we chose to do use this component to show different options and sections in the row. Each card starts with an image that should represent the ticket, followed by the ticket name (regular/plus/premium/pro), after that a short description can be read about what each ticket contains as a pack. <br>
Once the tickets are added to the cart, it’s time for finalizing the order. The user is now required to fill in the personal details such as email, address, and password. This will immediately make an account, and upon next order the user can simply log in instead of having to fill in each detail again. The form itself is responsive as well. Upon clicking the ‘confirm order’ button a pop-up will appear saying confirmed order, to show the user that their order has been successfully placed and they should receive an email soon. This form however is not functional yet.

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">contact page</span><br>
				 
				
As for the contact page, we decided to have a clear message box where you can contact us. This comment / message will be received by us via e-mail and will be handled by our customer support. Because our target audience is very active on the social media platforms Instagram, Twitter and Facebook we have put the logos in there as well as a link to our official page. We did not hyperlink the links because we don’t have official Facebook and Twitter pages, so it would lead to nothing otherwise. In the bigger contact form on this page we did not use placeholder text because, it is clearly mentioned above the text boxes what you have to fill in, it would be double and too busy if we would incorporate that. 
<br>
Down below, we have chosen to put a widget to expose our Instagram Feed. This is, because our visitor has a more clear idea of what we do and what we stand for. This is highly visual, but if your hover on the picture you will also see the caption, so it will become textual as well.

We have had 6 people testing our website. This was after we coded the website, so this is clearer and more visibly than when we would have done it with our paper prototype. But on the other hand, our website could also be distracting to the testers, while we already put a lot of visuals in there. We let the testers wonder around on our online website and then we asked them questions and given them tasks. <br><br>
Testers:<br>
					  <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Ruth van Haaren, woman, 28 years old, laptop 13’.<br>

			 <h2></h2>
		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">outcomes</span><br>
				 
				 
How serious were they? <br> <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Ruth and Pleun both were concentrated while fulfilling the tasks, they both told that they think it was because of the clear, not messy, website. It was not distracting at all.<br>
*	Marise and Marijke were both very serious and also engaged in visiting the website.<br>
*	Lois and Manon were both very engaged in the website.<br><br></span>

Would they want to have small things changed, or the entire concept of the website?<br>
				  <span style="font-style: italic">
*	They like the website concept and the idea of a platform, but they are convinced that it should be changed that they could really buy a ticket or get in contact with the brand via the sheet in the contact page when the website was really taken into practice.<br>
*	Pleun found out, while wondering around the website, that the brand wants to create a real community, therefor she would like the idea of a forum/chat function to really ask questions and help other users out.<br>
*	For Marise it was easy to understand that Ducia organizes events for which you can buy tickets. She would not change it, since it was very obvious because of the page ‘events’ and the clear buttons via which you can buy the tickets.<br>
*	Marijke would suggest having a forum to discuss subjects or events. She would also have incorporated a video of a previous event somewhere (testimonials, events page) so visitors have an even better idea of what to expect.<br>
*	Lois; was a bit confused about the soft colours of pink at the footer and then the pictures of the events. Maybe this was just ‘bad luck’ as her carousel was the one of the parties, when she first opened it.  She first thought about lingerie and then when seeing the photo, it was a bit strange for her. BUT she soon figured the overall vibe out correct and was able to adjust.  <br>
*	Both Manon and lois said it was hard to figure out what kind of events. It isn’t shouted at you. You have to read between the lines.  Lois quoted “The first home page immediate start with a lot of text.  And the About page is more about the  vision and mission. So I had to read between the lines of what it actually does. . Maybe somewhere at the top immediately state what ducia does.”<br><br></span>
					 
Effective: Where they able what to do what they were asked for?<br> 
					  <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Ruth was able to visit all the right pages to find the information, via the navigation bar. She could find everything, but not every button was working, so in the end she was not able to buy a ticket for an event, or really get in contact with the brand.<br>
*	Pleun was wondering around the website and she quickly found all the information she was looking for, but she was also not able to really buy and pay for a ticket or get in contact with the brand.<br>
*	Both Marise and Marijke were very quick with finding the information to buy tickets. This was also due to the fact that there are just clear pages with not too much of information to scroll through.<br>
*	When asked to do specific tasked both Manon and Lois easily could find their ways through. Again, some buttons didn’t work. Manon noted that she couldn’t click on the next month. And Instagram link didn’t work<br><br></span>

Efficient: Could they achieve the tasks quickly?<br>
						   <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Ruth and Pleun both were able to do it really fast, everything was to be found via the navigation bar or footer, they gave positive feedback on that.<br>
*	Marise and Marijke have achieved the tasks quickly. <br>
*	It was easy to change between pages, but the ticket buying was hard as there is no chart where you can go to. Manon quoted “I assumed the sign in sheet was for tickets, but I see it is for the News letter”. Also, the link to the Instagram didn’t work.<br><br></span>
					 
Engaging: Do they find it pleasant and satisfying or dull and frustrating?<br>
							    <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Ruth really liked the colors and simplicity of the website. Everything was clear and this made her enjoy the aesthetics.<br>
*	Pleun liked the website, especially that it was so clear and everything was easy to find, it was not frustrating at all. <br>
*	Marise really thought that it was a nice, clear structure. Since she was on a phone, it was also practical that the headers of each page were relatively big, so she knew exactly on which page she was.<br>
*	Marijke really liked the layout of the website. It is very structured, and she described it as ‘aestethic’. 
*	Manon really liked the overall feeling and style; she also liked the contact page since more clear photos of the ‘empowerment’ became very clear after seeing that page what ducia wants. Lois was a bit confused at the start but later she was fine with it<br><br></span>
					 
Error Tolerant: Could the users find their mistakes and correct them?<br>
									 <span style="font-style: italic">
*	When they were wondering around and visiting the pages, they could easily return to the home page, which results in starting again and keep on wondering around.<br><br></span>
					 
Easy to learn? Could they quickly adapt and operate on the website?<br>
										  <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Afterwards Pleun and Ruth both still knew how to find the different pages that they were asked to visit, from this, we conclude that it was easy to learn and remember what they did.<br>
*	Marise and Marijke were both very quick in wandering through the website without any difficulties.<br>
*	Yes, Manon and Lois said the pages, and all are very clear, despite the buttons not working they know what they do etc.<br><br></span>

Overall general feedback:<br>
											   <span style="font-style: italic">
*	They liked the website, the colors and the aesthetics. They enjoyed the time wondering around and checking out a new website. They would visit it when it became reality, but there need to be a few small adjustments.<br>
*	The website was really nice according to Marise and Marijke. They were pleased to see the nice design in combination with an easy structure of website. <br>
*	They both were positive about the website, despite some links didn’t work. Also they both couldn’t figure out what kind of events they host.<br>

		     <p><span style="font-weight:bold">recommmendations</span><br>
				 
				 
What parts of the website did they affect?<br>
				 <span style="font-style: italic">
*	We got feedback mostly on the events page because of the fact that it was not very clear what the events were about and what was offered to our guests. Also it was not possible to literally buy a ticket and the differences between the tickets were not explained. This needs to be changed if the website is going to be taken into use. One of the testers also came up with an idea to broaden the website and its community feel by creating a chat function or a forum like page.<br><br></span>

Also, we have some specific points were improvement is needed on the website, what we were not capable of with our knowledge and opportunities, these are listed below:<br>
				 <span style="font-style: italic">
*	Log in option. <br>
*	Ticket Payment option.<br>
